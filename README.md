# JS | Whack A Mole Game


## Introduction

This game is based on the classic Whack A Mole game.

In this version you'll find different characters to whack, each one with a different score for the player.

The game consists of an empty tiles where the moles and other characters will appear randomly. When a character is on the field, the player will have to whack it before it disappears.

Before the game starts, the player can chose the difficulty level of the game. There are 3 possible levels (easy, medium and hard), and the differences among them are the number of possible locations for the characters and the speed at which they appear.

The game starts by clicking on the **Start** button, since then, the player has one minute to get a score as higher as possible. The points are added to the score when clicking on a character while it is on the field. But be careful! Not all characters are good for you...

Characters:
  - Moles: Add one point to the score.
  - Minion with the hooter: Adds 10 points to the score.
  - Rest of Minions: Add 5 points to the score.
  - Dugtrio (Pokemon with 3 heads): Subtracts 1 point from the score.
  - Hans Topo: Subtracts all the points from the score and the game is over.


The goal of the game is to get as many points as possible in one single minute.
